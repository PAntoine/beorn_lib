# Beorn Lib #
## version 2.1.1 ##

This is a platform independent library that has the goal of supplying components for supporting
text editor plugins. It is designed to allow for coder oriented text plugins to be build and
ported other text editors.

It has been written python.

## Release status ##
- Missing Logging, It's starting to show.
- Need to remove some unused and useless features.
- Documentation is lacking and comments are crap and scarce.

## running tests ##

    `python test`
or
	`python test TestQuery test_getSourceTree`

which will run just the one test.

This takes the following parameters:
    -s       - only run the SCM tests
    -t       - only run the non-SCM tests
    -h       - print the help.
    -l       - print list of tests.

## Changes ##

Enhancements:
    - Don't forget the untracked files for Git for SourceTree
